This program is to be used as a way to get files to a home server from a remote location.
It will also help manage downloaded files to help remove duplication of efforts.
It is intended to use an already working web server

PHP will take the request from the remote user, put the request information into a MYSQL 
database, then a python script will be ran to start a wget or cURL instance.

The python script will manage the downloading instances to try and effectively manage the
downloads to maximize the network usage, while still allowing users to use the network.

A git repo will be the source control for this project.

Stage 1:
	
	Get the initial stuff working.
	
	index.php
		bare essentails to work
	upload.php

		check to see if the file already exists with md5
		add the statisitic of the download to the mysql database
		
	fdlmMySQL database
		3 table
			1: file internet statistics
			2: download queue
			3: file local statistics
	python script
		System call to wget
	
	To be complete with stage 1 a successful test of a remote user to the home server must be 
	performed with a file of > 300 

later Stages:
	
	index.php
		visually pleasing and use information
	status.php
		show current status of downloads
			use js to update the status
